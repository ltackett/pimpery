[Pick a card...](http://projects.scribblemark.org/cards "Demo of Cards...")

---

Cards is a demo of some advanced CSS3 transforms and a few transitions that are currently only available in Webkit. Cards was built with [Compass](http://compass-style.org) and a touch of [jQuery](http://jquery.com). The effect is a faux 3D coverflow-like element. This could be useful someday, but right now it's just for fun.

A minor caveat: This looks like ass in Safari 4 (Mac), but looks awsm in Chrome 5 (Mac). I tested in Firefox, and it works without the transitions as expected.

I expect it to work in Opera the same way it works in Firefox, and I guarantee is will promptly fall completely on its face in anything built by Microsoft.
